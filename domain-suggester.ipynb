    "Your task is to generate {NUM_OF_SUGGESTIONS} high-potential domain name ideas for a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BRAND STRATEGY LOGIC:\n",
    "1. **The Radio Test:** If heard once, the spelling must be intuitive. No intentional misspellings (e.g., no 'Kleen' for 'Clean').\n",
    "2. **Outcome-Centric:** Prioritize the *feeling* or *benefit* (e.g., 'Swift' vs. 'FastDelivery').\n",
    "3. **Phonosemantics:** Use hard consonants (k, t, p) for tech/efficiency; soft vowels (o, a, l) for wellness/luxury.\n",
    "4. **Syllable Economy:** Maximum 3 syllables. 1-2 is the \"Gold Standard.\"\n",
    "5. **Alphabet Check:** If there are non-latin characters, convert them to latin. Suggestions should STRICTLY include ONLY latin characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### NAMING ARCHETYPES (Provide a mix):\n",
    "- **Evocative:** Uses a real word that captures a vibe (e.g., 'Patagonia', 'Slack').\n",
    "- **Compound:** Two short words joined (e.g., 'DoorDash', 'YouTube').\n",
    "- **Abstract/Blended:** Unique, brandable sounds or prefixes (e.g., 'Zillow', 'Vanta').\n",
    "- **Oxymoronic:** If the business has conflicting goals (e.g., 'CheapLuxury'), create a name that bridges the gap (e.g., 'GrandLite').\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXAMPLES OF HIGH QUALITY DOMAINS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business: AI-driven logistics platform that makes shipping invisible and effortless.\n",
    "   Strategy: Focus on the \"Outcome\" (Benefit over Feature).\n",
    "   Suggestions: ['EasyCargo', 'VanishShipping', 'PackageArrived']\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Business: High-end organic skincare that uses ancient volcanic minerals.\n",
    "   Strategy: Use \"Phonosemantics\" (Soft vowels for luxury, hard roots for minerals).\n",
    "   Suggestions: ['MineralSkin', 'Vitre', 'AshLuxe', 'RelicCare']\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Business: A budget airline that feels like a private club.\n",
    "   Strategy: \"Oxymoronic Branding\" (Bridging high-end vibes with low-cost reality).\n",
    "   Suggestions: ['WingPrive', 'Goldjet', 'ApexAir']\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Business: Professional-grade coding tools for children/beginners.\n",
    "   Strategy: \"The Radio Test\" (Short, punchy, easy to spell).\n",
    "   Suggestions: ['Koda', 'Codio', 'FableCode']\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Business: A neighborhood bakery in Brooklyn using traditional Polish recipes.\n",
    "   Strategy: \"Evocative/Local\" (Hinting at heritage without being a literal map).\n",
    "   Suggestions: ['CrustPL', 'Cracow', 'BabkaBakery']\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CORE BRAND STRATEGY PRINCIPLES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Radio Test Compliance:** Names must be instantly spellable when heard aloud. No ambiguous spellings.  \n",
    "2. **Outcome-Centric Positioning:** Names should evoke the emotional transformation or benefit, not the functional mechanism.  \n",
    "3. **Phonosemantic Intentionality:**  \n",
    "   - Hard consonants (K, T, P, D) → speed, precision, authority  \n",
    "   - Soft consonants (L, M, F, V) → trust, luxury, flow  \n",
    "   - Open vowels (A, O) → warmth, approachability  \n",
    "4. **Syllable Economy:** Prefer 2 syllables; maximum 3.  \n",
    "5. **Constraint Absolutism:** No exceptions—rules must be strictly followed.  \n",
    "6. **Structural Sophistication:** Avoid \"Generic Compound\" names (e.g., CarInsurance.com). \n",
    "    If using a compound, ensure it creates a new \"concept\" (e.g., PayPal, DoorDash).\n",
    "7. **Non-Descriptive Rule:** Names should convey *vibe*, not function.  \n",
    "   - Example: Use “Bolt” instead of “FastDrop.”  \n",
    "8. **Anti-Generic Filter:** Avoid feature-like names. If it sounds like a product description, it fails.  \n",
    "9. **Morpheme Variety:** Prefer subtle Latinate or Greek roots to create “new-real” words (e.g., Aura + ly → Auraly).  \n",
    "10. **Verb Potential (“Bar Test”):** Could users naturally say “I’ll [Brand Name] it”? Names that are too long or clunky fail.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## TWO-STAGE NAMING PROCESS\n",
    "\n",
    "### STAGE 1 — STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE\n",
    "1.1 Semantic Deconstruction: Identify core emotional outcomes and 3-5 brand adjectives.\n",
    "1.2 Ideation: Generate a \"Long List\" of 15-20 raw ideas across different archetypes.\n",
    "1.3 Validation: Select the best candidates and run them through this checklist:\n",
    "- Name: [Candidate]\n",
    "- Syllable Count: [X] \n",
    "- Radio Test: [Pass/Fail]\n",
    "- Phonosemantic Alignment: [Brief Logic]\n",
    "- Verdict: [Keep/Discard]\n",
    "\n",
    "### STAGE 2 — FINAL DELIVERABLES\n",
    "Present the top {NUM_OF_SUGGESTIONS} names.\n",
    "**[Name]**\n",
    "- **Logic:** [Why it works phonetically and strategically]\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## NAMING ARCHETYPE GUIDE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evocative Names:** Emotional resonance, analogies, or metaphorical associations.  \n",
    "*Examples:* Stripe (movement), Asana (flow), Notion (idea spark)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Compound Names:** Fuse two concrete concepts for clarity.  \n",
    "*Examples:* PayPal (payment + friend), Snapchat (instant + conversation)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract/Invented Names:** Fully original linguistic constructs.  \n",
    "*Examples:* Figma, Canva, Airtable  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Oxymoronic/Paradox Names:** Combine opposites to create distinctive positioning.  \n",
    "*Examples:* LegalZoom (law + speed), QuickBooks (accounting + ease)\n",
    "\n",
